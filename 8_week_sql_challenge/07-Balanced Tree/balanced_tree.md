# Data Cleaning

Checking for duplicates in Sales (Products only contains 12 Items, they are all unique)
```sql
WITH duplicates_cte AS(
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS num_occurences,
  prod_id,
  qty,
  price,
  discount,
  member,
  txn_id,
  start_txn_time
FROM
balanced_tree.sales
GROUP BY 
  prod_id,
  qty,
  price,
  discount,
  member,
  txn_id,
  start_txn_time)
SELECT
*
FROM
duplicates_cte
WHERE num_occurences > 1;
```

- no duplicates


# High Level Sales Analysis

1. What was the total quantity sold for all products?

I am first varifying that all sales have a txn_id that is not null. (I would expect only valid transactions to have a txn_id)
```sql
SELECT
COUNT(*)
FROM 
balanced_tree.sales
WHERE txn_id IS NULL;
```
- 0 NULL txn_ids

```sql
SELECT
  product_id,
  product_name,
  SUM(s.qty) AS num_sold
FROM
  balanced_tree.sales AS s
  JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd ON s.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY 
product_id,
product_name;
```

|product_id|product_name                    |num_sold|
|----------|--------------------------------|--------|
|2a2353    |Blue Polo Shirt - Mens          |3819    |
|e83aa3    |Black Straight Jeans - Womens   |3786    |

2. What is the total generated revenue for all products before discounts?

```sql
SELECT 
SUM(qty * price) AS total_revenue
FROM 
balanced_tree.sales;
```
- 1289453

3. What was the total discount amount for all products?
```sql
WITH discount_cte AS(
    SELECT
      qty,
      CASE
        WHEN discount != 0 THEN ROUND(price * (discount :: NUMERIC / 100), 2)
        ELSE 0
      END AS discount_amount
    FROM
      balanced_tree.sales
  )
SELECT
SUM(qty*discount_amount) AS total_discount_amount
FROM
discount_cte;
